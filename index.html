    <div class="highlight">Hello, at today's meeting we covered</div>

    <ul>
        <li>Who will win the NBA Finals (Wolves in 7)</li>
        <li>Who is the greatest NBA player in the league right now (Anthony Edwards)</li>
        <li>Who is the greatest NBA player of all time (Lebron James)</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>This meeting took only <b>three</b> days as opposed to our last meeting which took a whole week.</p>
    <p>We are definitely becoming more efficient with our timing but I'm still not sure why people do not admit that <strong>Lebron James is the greatest basketball player of all time.</strong></p>
    <p>Unfinished notes is that we still need to figure out our playoffs brackets.</p>
    <p>Something to discuss for the next meeting is who will win MVP this season.</p>
    <p>SGA is definitely not <i>MVP</i> material because every single one of his points are shot at the free throw line.</p>
    <p>However I also think Jokic is not MVP either.</p>
    <p>It definitely should be Anthony Edwards and if he does not win MVP he was <em>snubbed</em> out of his MVP spot.</p>
    <p>Heres an image of my favorite basketball player.</p>
